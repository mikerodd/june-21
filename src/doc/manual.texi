@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
This documentation covers the use of the June-21 VST synthetizer, a open source Roland Juno-1 / Juno-2 / MKS-50 emulator using
CSound (@url{https://csound.com}) and Cabbage (@url{https://www.cabbageaudio.com/}).

June-21 can read and play Juno 1 / 2 MKS-50 presets. The emulator includes Juno 2 factory "Preset" and "Memory" bank tones.
Many tones can be found on the web, in a form of a @file{.SYX} bulk dump extracted from synths.


The text and schematics are partly inspired by the original Juno-2 documentation.

The look of the GUI is obviously inspired by the Roland PG-300.

@b{Nota Bene:} June-21 is still in development and is not a perfect emulator, so some tones can be far from the real thing and some won't work
(but some can be very accurate and pleasing!). As of now (Dec 2019) one thing is not implemented : @b{Aftertouch}. It won't be done (at least by me) as
my own Juno-2's aftertouch is not working.

@i{Have fun !}

@section Using distributions
There are ready-to-use distribution available :
@itemize @bullet
@item @file{vst-june-21-linux.zip} : VST@footnote{Virtual Studio Technology (VST) is an audio plug-in software interface that integrates software synthesizer and effects in digital audio workstations, created by Steinberg.} distribution for GNU/Linux
@item @file{standalone-june-21-windows64.zip} : Standalone distribution for Windows 64-bits
@end itemize



@subsection Windows Installation
Download and unzip the appropriate file, execute @file{june-21.exe} 

@subsection GNU/Linux Installation
Download and unzip the appropriate file, use @file{june-21.so} in your DAW or your favorite VST container. 

@section Using Cabbage
If you want to test/modify June-21, you can use Cabbage and open @file{june-21.csd} as you would do with any other Cabbage source files.

Note that a custom plugin is included, @file{libjsl} (source available in the @file{plugins/junosyxloader} section of the repository).
This plugin interacts with the @file{.SYX} files (load tone, modify tone), it's a plain C program, you will need @file{CMake} and @file{CSound} headers
installed in order to recompile it.

@node Synth Description
@chapter Synth Description

June-21 consists of several blocks as shown below. Each block of the synth section is controlled by
relevant tone-color parameters

@image{blockdiagram,15cm,,,.png}

@itemize @bullet
@item @image{one,0.4cm,,,.png} @b{DCO (Digitally Controlled Osillator)}

DCO is the digitally controled oscillator that controls the pitch and generates the waveforms that are the sound source of the synthesizer.

@item @image{two,0.4cm,,,.png} @b{HPF (High Pass Filter)}

The HPF is a filter that passes high frequency harmonics and cuts off the lower ones. This changes the waveform and controls the tone color.

@item @image{three,0.4cm,,,.png} @b{VCF (Voltage Controlled Filter)}

Each VCF lets lower frequency harmonics of the input signal pass and cuts off the higher ones. In other words, it is a usual low pass filter.
By controlling the cutoff point and resonance, the waveform changes, thereby the tone color alters.

@item @image{four,0.4cm,,,.png} @b{VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier)}

After filtered in the VCF, the signal is fed to the VCA where the volume (amplitude) of the sound is controlled.

@item @image{five,0.4cm,,,.png} @b{CHORUS}

The chorus duplicates the signal with a pitch change, giving a rich and shimmering quality.

@item @image{six,0.4cm,,,.png} @b{LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator)}

This oscillator generates extremely low frequency, so produces a vibrato or growl effect by controlling the DCO or VCF.

@item @image{seven,0.4cm,,,.png} @b{ENV (Envelop Generator)}

This generates the control voltage (Envelope) which controls the DCO, VCF and VCA, therefore
alters the pitch, tone color and volume in each note.

@node Settings
@chapter Settings

@section DCO Block (Digitally Controlled Oscillator)

@center @image{dcoblock,10cm,,,.png}


@subsection DCO Range
@image{dcorng,1cm,,,.png}
This is to change the pitch range of the DCO in exact one octave steps from 4' to 32' (4', 8', 16', 32').
8' is standard.

@subsection DCO LFO Depth
@image{dcolfo,1cm,,,.png}
When the LFO is controlling the pitch of the DCO, this adjusts the depth of the vibrato effect
in the range of 0 to 127.

@subsection DCO ENV Depth
@image{dcoenv,1cm,,,.png}
When the ENV is controlling the pitch of the DCO, this parameter sets the depth of the modulation in
the range of 0 to 127.

@subsection DCO ENV Mode
@image{dcoenvd,1.77cm,,,.png}
This selects the polarity of the envelope curve that controls the DCO.
Usually @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} may by used. In @image{adsri,0.5cm,,,.png} mode,
ADSR pattern will be inverted.

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{Normal} @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV serves to increase the DCO's pitch.
@item @b{Invert} @image{adsri,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV serves to decrease the DCO's pitch.
@item @b{Normal with Dynamics} @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV with Dynamics serves to increase the DCO's pitch.
@item @b{Invert with Dynamics} @image{adsri,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV with Dynamics serves to decrease the DCO's pitch.
@end itemize

@subsection DCO Bender Range
@image{dcobnd,1cm,,,.png}

This  sets the maximum effect of the Picth Bender caused by moving the Pitch Bender/Modulation lever, 0 to 12
are valid for this parameter, and 1 is semi-tone, therefore 12 is an otave.



@subsection Pulse
@image{pulse,1.187cm,,,.png}
Pulse wave selected, according the selection, 3 different pulses are generated. The pulse @image{pulse3,0.5cm,,,.png} can
be set at DCO PW/PWM Depth.

@subsection Sawtooth
@image{sawtooth,1.187cm,,,.png}
Sawtooth wave selected, according the selection, 5 different pulses are generated. The sawtooth @image{sawtooth3,0.5cm,,,.png} can
be set at DCO PW/PWM Depth.

@subsection Sub
@image{sub,1.375cm,,,.png}
This selects the waveform of the Sub Oscillator that generates a pitch one or two octaves lower than the pulse ware or the
sawtooth wave.

@subsection Sub Oscillator Waveform
@image{sub,1.375cm,,,.png}
This selects the waveform of the Sub Oscillator that generates a pitch one or two octaves lower than the pulse ware or the
sawtooth wave.

@itemize
@item @image{sub1,0.5cm,,,.png}, @image{sub2,0.5cm,,,.png}, @image{sub3,0.5cm,,,.png} and @image{sub4,0.4cm,,,.png} are one octave lower
@item @image{sub5,0.5cm,,,.png} and @image{sub2,0.6cm,,,.png} are two octave lower
@end itemize


@subsection Sub Oscillator Level
@image{sublevl,1cm,,,.png}
This sets the volume of the Sub Oscillator from 0 to 3. At 0 there is no oscillation.

@subsection DCO Noise Level
@image{noislvl,1cm,,,.png}
This sets the volume of the White Noise, 0 to 3 are valide, at 0, there is no Noise generated.

@subsection DCO PW/PWM Depth
@image{pwpwm,1cm,,,.png}
This parameter works only on the Pulse Wave 3 or the Sawtooth Wave 3. The pulse width of a wave can be determined by the value
from 0 to 127.

@subsection DCO PW/PWM Depth
@image{pwmrate,1cm,,,.png}
This parameter works only on the Pulse Wave 3 or the Sawtooth Wave 3. The rate of the LFO modulation that changes the pulse
width of the waveform ca be set. 0 to 127 are the values valid for this parameter. At 0, however, the pulse width is not
modulated by the LFO but set at the PW/PWM Depth. When this parameter is set to a value other than 0, the pulse width set with
the DCO PW/PWM Depth is the widest pulse made by the LFO modulation.

@section HPF Block (High Pass Filter)
@image{hpfblock,1cm,,,.png}

This parameter changes the cutoff point of the HPF:

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{0} : The lower frequencies are emphasized (High Shelving at ~106Hz)
@item @b{1} : HPF is off
@item @b{2} : Cutoff point is set at lower frequency (~124 Hz)
@item @b{3} : Cutoff point is set at higet than 2  (~220 Hz). The produced sound is harder and thinner 
@end itemize

@section VCF Block (Voltage Controlled Filter)
@center @image{vcfblock,6.583cm,,,.png}


@subsection VCF Cutoff Requency
@image{vcffreq,1cm,,,.png}
This is for changing the cutoff point of the VCF. As you decrease the value, the cutoff frequency will
come down, and the waveform gradually becomes approximation of a sine wave, then the sound will fade out.
0 to 127 are valid for this parameter.

@center@image{vcfcutoffdiag,16cm,,,.png}

@subsection VCF Resonance
@image{vcfreso,1cm,,,.png}
This parameter emphasizes the cutoff point set at the VCF Cutoff Frequency. 
0 to 127 are valid for this parameter

@subsection VCF LFO
@image{vcflfo,1cm,,,.png}
This parameter sets the depth of the LFO modulation that changes the cutoff point of the
VCF (growl effect). 0 to 127 are valid for this parameter.

@subsection VCF Env
@image{vcfenv,1cm,,,.png}
This parameter controls the cutoff point of the VCF in each not with the ENV curve set in the
ENV section. As you increase the value, tone color within one note changes mor drastically.
0 to 127 are valid for this parameter.

@subsection VCF Env
@image{vcfenvd,1.75cm,,,.png}
This is to select the polarity ot the Envelope curve that controls the cutoff point of the VCF.
Usually, @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} may be used, in @image{adsri,0.5cm,,,.png} mode, ADSR pattern will
be inverted.

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{Normal} @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV serves to increase the VCF's cutoff point.
@item @b{Invert} @image{adsri,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV serves to decrease the VCF's cutoff point.
@item @b{Normal with Dynamics} @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV with Dynamics serves to increase the VCF's cutoff point.
@item @b{dyn} : This mode is rather special ; the ENV has nothing to do with the VCF's cutoff point and the Dynamics directly
works to increase the VCF's cutoff point.
@end itemize


@section VCA Block (Voltage Controlled Amplifier)
@center @image{vcablock,3.416cm,,,.png}

@subsection VCA Level
@image{vcalevl,1cm,,,.png}

This is for changing the volume, and can be effeively used when writing a tone color.
When the value is set too high, sound may be distorted.

@subsection VCA ENV Mode
@image{vcaenvd,1.93cm,,,.png}

This is to select whether to control the VCA by the signal from the ENV or by the Gate
signal (Key On/Off signal).

@center @image{vcadiag,10cm,,,.png}

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{ENV} @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV changes the volume.
@item @b{Gate} @image{gaten,0.5cm,,,.png} : Gate signal changes the volume.
@item @b{ENV} @image{adsrn,0.5cm,,,.png} : ENV with Dynamics changes the volume.
@item @b{Gate} @image{gaten,0.5cm,,,.png} : Gate signal with Dynamics changes the volume.

@end itemize

@section CHORUS Block
@center @image{chorus,2.6cm,,,.png}

@subsection Chorus On/Off
This turns on or off the Chorus effect.

@subsection Chorus Rate
This parameter determines the rate of the horus effect from 0 to 127.


@section LFO Block (Low Frequency Oscillator)
@center @image{lfoblock,2.25cm,,,.png}

@subsection LFO Rate
This parameter changes the rate of the LO modulation. 0 to 127 are valid for this parameter

@subsection LFO Delay Time
This parameter sets the time needed for the LFO modulation to work from the moment
the key is played.
0 to 126 are valid for this parameter



@section ENV Block (Envelope Generator)
@center @image{envblock,8.437cm,,,.png}

@subsection Envelope definition
The parameters of this part defines the ADSR envelope, 0 to 127 are valid for all parameters :

@center @image{envdiag,8.437cm,,,.png}

@subsection ENV Keyboard Follower
the time required for the envelope to complete its curve can be changed depending on which key is pressed.
O to 15 are valid for this parameter.
There is no change of the time at all when it is set to 0, but as the value is increased, envelope time
become shorter with higher key pressed.



@node Using Tones
@chapter Using Tones

@center @image{usingbulkdump,8.25cm,,,.png}

@section Tone organisation
There are 8 tones per banks and 8 banks in a group (64 tones per group). Groups are usually extracted from
Junos via a Bulk Data Transfer resulting on a binary file known as SysEx file (short @file{.SYX}) for
Midi System Exclusive messages.

June-21 includes the two factory presets of the Juno 2 and a blank group :

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{PRESET} : Contains the factory preset of the Juno 2 (@file{presets/FACTORYA.SYX})
@item @b{MEMORY} : Contains the factory memory of the Juno 2 (@file{presets/FACTORYB.SYX})
@item @b{FILE} : mapped to an empty cartridge in order to store user tones (@file{presets§/USERCART.SYX})
@end itemize

You can change tone using @b{1} to @b{8} bank or number buttons and @b{PRESET}, @b{MEMORY} and @b{FILE}.

@section Change Tone name
@image{chname1,8.27cm,,,.png}
You can modify the tone name by using @b{<} and @b{>} to navigate through the name. The green slider can be used to
change the underscored character.

@section Save Tone
To save a tone, 3 steps :
@itemize @bullet
@item use the @b{Copy} button. June-21 transfers all parameters in a buffer.
@item Select a destination Tone. If you want to overwrite current tone, just stay in this tone
@item Use the @b{Paste} button, your buffer is saved on the current tone of the @file{.SYX} file.
@end itemize

@b{Nota Bene} : There is no mechanism protecting the factory presets ! 

@section Use other Tones

You can download a lot of @file{.SYX} files on the internet ! Here is very interesting source :  @url{http://www.llamamusic.com/mks50/mks-50_patches.html}

Once you have a @file{.SYX} file you want to try, use the @b{...} button to load it as a file.

@b{Nota Bene} : June-21 is not a finished emulator, so some tones might not sound as expected...
