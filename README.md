## Status 
June-21 can read and play Juno 1 / 2 MKS-50 presets. The emulator includes Juno 2 factory "Preset" and "Memory". 

You can also find many presets here : http://www.llamamusic.com/mks50/mks-50_patches.html, you can test them with June-21 !

It's still a work in progress, so not all presets will work as in the real gear, some presets might not be working.


*Have fun*



## requirement 
Linux - CSound must be present in the system 
Windows - a CSound runtime is in the distrib file
